# Scriptable

A functionality I made for testing purposes can be built into the tool as a 
feature. After some time with the fzf you learn there are certain strings you 
can press which will summon the correct file from a pool of names. If you are 
working with such a pool where you can reliably summon the resource you want 
then you can give that incantation as a command and the fzf will operate in 
scripting mode to return the match immediately. This lets you hotkey certain 
even more specific file(s).

Out of current scope but will become a feature.

## vim ideas

+ `pdm` -> `pydymenu`
